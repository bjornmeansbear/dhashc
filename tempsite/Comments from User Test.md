I looked at your site. I thought it was an interesting layout, but I was a bit perplexed about what to do when I got there. I clicked the boxes, saw the text/colors change, etc., but I didn’t quite get it. I’m not quite sure what you intended for me to leave with, as a result of that experience. That’s my raw reaction to it.

I played with the site on win7, win8 and android phone.
The site has been designed with Chrome in mind. it does not work on IE8/9/10. experience on the phone needs to be optimized, basically detect the mobile browser and have a different layout for the phone screen. Another feedback is that there is too much white space. BTW, did you do this yourself or have someone do it for you? The design looks nice, just need to polish it and test it across multiple browsers.

I accessed the site first from my Google smart phone : on a mobile device it totally confused me on how to scroll. I clicked on the first black 'O-P/E=N and I read the text ..."The distinction...." ....then I clicked on the next OPEN chip ....and the next. That was it...did not go any further on my mobile coz it seemed like that was all to it.

So I picked up the iPad and typed in the url knowing for sure there must be more to it.

Here is what I felt going through the site on the iPad:

1. You gotta have a home icon somewhere on the page. 
2. The transition of text on each [open] equation is not intuitive i.e. I did not click on the text again or notice that the 4 colored scroll system as a sign to do so. I just went to the next [open] equation and then to the third. 
3. Then there is a large white space (I suppose the idea is ' Apple' ...'Google' type simplicity) before the Einstein quote appears. Honestly I did not link the quote to what it was referring to. 
4. The idea of white space as a design tool is cool, but for a first time user like me -  i suppose in your mind your audience is not as dumb as me! :) - I found it gave an incomplete feel to the website.
5. "The system" link or button is small/invisible/ can be missed 
6. Finally when you come to the system where you have the canvas "Design is code" ..."Ideas are statements" ..."Active minds" the user should be able to swipe horizontally to scroll to the next screens. Somehow I am not convinced that everyone will understand the way to scroll to next screen is to click on each of the squares below.
7. The last page at the end of that scroll i.e. the 6th square:
design#code : A system for developing breakthrough solutions in the form factor of services. That looks awesome and tells you about design#code...finally! This should be somewhere right at the home page or beginning of the website. It defines what you product it and yet I have to wait till I go through all of the website to finally....go....Aaaha...so that's what the website is all about.

I hope you're well. It was not immediately apparent that your site was interactive, when I click on the blocks, something happened. Also when I first arrived I had the three big black rectangles which consumed the whole screen, so I did not know at first what design code was (see screen shot).

You have a lot of good content there. Maybe you need some tabs - first impression/overview, deeper dive "the code," etc.

There are some grammatical problems such as “This equation governs the value an entire class of goods;” .  I won’t note all of them but if you are paying someone to build this, they should be more aware of this. 

I like the metaphor that “OPEN” kind of invites you to click on the integrated circuit.  You need to change the pointer to a pointing finger or arrow when one mouse’s over so they realize this.  Or maybe when the mouse is traveling over the circuit, it displays “click”. Is there a way that when the user clicks on the “OPEN “circuit, it highlights the squares below based on the number of clicks in addition to the currently capability of clicking the colored squares? The color of the squares do not match the text tiles as one goes through the sequence.

This is coming along nicely, Generally it flows good but some of the transitions need to be cleaned up and the “clicks” along the way need to be highlighted differently than a “black box”  This hides the color of the sequence.
 
I tried this site on my iPhone.  It does not fit the form factor.  Maybe an app needs to be developed, or at least a different form factor.  I also tried it on an iPad and I worked almost like the site.

1. The OPEN sequence is a little confusing as to what to do when you visit the home page.
2. The small square boxes aren't distinct enough to be clickable or show content.
3. Navigation is extremely confusing until you get to the Einstein quote.
4. I'd follow Duarte's methodology of storytelling, its the best way to illustrate a narrative.http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0596522347
5. I would include a teaser case study without revealing too much.

When you open the page, the initial impression is good, but the User may not know there is more content below unless you click through all the boxes. You see the 3 boxes and there is a of white space

Between each section of the page and transition, you assume that the user will follow your site flow and expect there is more content below. Suggest adding a very small "more content arrow" or marker

Have the site store a cookie to remember if a user has been there before. every time you refresh the page, you are forced to go through the flow again.

There is a lot of white space to scroll through. The page is designed by default with the first time navigation story in mind. Repeat users will get annoyed.

"If you site is currently just a way to get people to learn about your company and contact you, then the first time flow looks good. But if you plan to add more content, you would want to consider having an alternate home screen to repeat visitors where they can access other site content without having to go through the navigation"

It's really difficult for me to understand that it's necessary to scroll down the page.  Love all the copy.  Well written, makes sense, intriguing.  Don't like the use of triple black O-P/E=N image that we see right when we land on the page.  Like the copy under each O-P/E=N  but just use image once.  hmmm  What to do with all three bits of copy?  //OR//  I'd be really surprised if people realized that they should click the colorful boxes to go to the next image/copy.  I think it's better to just put the carousel on automatic, that way at least the viewer will see the hidden information.  If you time these at different speeds then the triple image won't be a problem.  I'm assuming the user can stop and move the carousel forward by clicking on a box.  Then the carousels below won't have to be put on automatic because we'll already understand how to access content.

What I get from reading user input is the following:

- Navigation confusing
- More markers/roadmaps/guidance useful
- a lot of rigamarole to get to the content
- If one returns to the site, it is not easy to get at information one might desire again …

Not obfuscating the navigation off the bat would immediately solve part of this problem. Then providing a clear breadcrumb of where they are as they scroll/click through the site will help — right now we hide where they are and only show where else they can go once they've gone through the top section and reached the “System” slideshow. Just changing this might solve a lot of the negative usability feedback.

As for auto playing the upper slideshows as a user completes one or another, this might be helpful — but it might also become more confusing as suddenly control over where/how someone is navigating is taken away. And, it requires even more elaborate coding.

More important are the questions:
1. Is the Einstein quote beneficial?
2. Does asking people to buy and read another document help explain design#code; is it beneficial?
or
Are the two secondary phases between “open” and “system” really necessary?
